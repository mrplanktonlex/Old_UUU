Keep karma.conf.js and package.json outside src/ and 
    where .angular-cli.json and package-lock.json are i.e. in ngrxproj03/ folder and not in any sub folder
    
    
    
Remember:-
  -- use only jasmine for unit testing. eg. new Component();
  -- use TestBed for integration testing . dont use new Component() here. 
  Angular should be able to create an instance of ur component and get it to you (using testbed).
